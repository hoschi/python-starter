    "**The Problem:** Your core business logic becomes tightly coupled to external systems like databases, APIs, or file systems. If your `user_service` directly imports and uses a `PostgresClient`, it's impossible to test the service without a real database, and switching to a different database becomes a major refactoring effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution:** We use `typing.Protocol` to invert the dependency. Instead of depending on a *concrete* class, our service depends on an *abstract interface* (the protocol). Any class that has the methods and signatures defined in the protocol can be used, without needing to inherit from it. This is also known as \"Static Duck Typing\".\n",

    "**The Problem:** When you have a function that accepts a `Union` of different types, you often use `if/isinstance` checks to handle each type. It's easy to forget to handle a new type if the `Union` is ever expanded, leading to runtime errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution:** Python's `match/case` statement (PEP 634) is a powerful tool for structural pattern matching. When used with a strict type checker like `BasedPyright`, it can perform **exhaustiveness checking**. If you have a `Union[A, B]` and only write a `case` for `A`, the type checker will raise an error, forcing you to handle all possible types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveat:** As noted in the project setup, mypy's plugin for the `returns` library currently has a bug that can lead to false positives when pattern matching on `Result`. For this reason, we recommend using pattern matching primarily on your own `Union` types or Pydantic models, and using `.map`/`.lash` for `Result`."
