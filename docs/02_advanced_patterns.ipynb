    "**Best Practice:** Our core business logic should not depend on concrete external systems like a specific database or API client. Instead, it should depend on an abstraction, a \"contract\". In Python, `typing.Protocol` is the perfect tool for defining these contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** This decouples our core logic from the outside world. It makes our code:\n",
    "- **Testable:** We can easily create a \"mock\" or \"fake\" implementation of the protocol for our tests.\n",
    "- **Flexible:** We can swap out the real implementation (e.g., move from a PostgreSQL database to a REST API) without changing a single line of our core logic."
